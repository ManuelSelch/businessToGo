# Time and Project Management iOS Application

## Overview

This SwiftUI iOS application is designed to streamline time and project management tasks. It integrates with two powerful open-source tools: **Kimai** and **Taiga**, providing a comprehensive solution for tracking time and managing projects effectively. The app supports offline functionality using an SQLite database and follows the Redux architecture pattern to ensure a predictable and maintainable state management.

## Features

- **Integration with Taiga**: Access Taiga's project management features to create, manage, and track project progress. Collaborate with team members and stay on top of deadlines.
- **Offline Mode**: Work offline with full functionality thanks to an integrated SQLite database. Sync data with Kimai and Taiga once you regain connectivity.
- **Redux Architecture**: Benefit from a predictable state management system that enhances maintainability and scalability.
